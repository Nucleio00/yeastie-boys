        The Yeastie Boys rise like fresh dough and hit harder than a brick oven at full blast. Formed in the backroom of a small-town bakery with nothing but a beat-up guitar, a thrift-store drum kit, and a questionable amount of sourdough starter, this high-energy rock crew bakes punk attitude into stadium-sized riffs.
        Their sound? Imagine Metallica jamming with AC/DC while a bread mixer whirs in the background — gritty, loud, and just a little wild around the edges. Known for their power-chord-heavy anthems like *Proofing the Revolution* and *Loaf ‘n’ Loaded*, The Yeastie Boys have kneaded their way into the hearts of fans who crave both crunch and chew in their music.
        On stage, they’re a flour-dusted whirlwind — shredding, sweating, and tossing bread rolls into the crowd. Whether you’re here for the headbanging or the fresh-baked puns, one thing’s for sure: this is rock you can sink your teeth into.
